# split

Split is a user test platform to evaluate navigation maps. The platform evaluates user behavior when solving tasks using the custom map.
The interface is split into two windows: on the left, the map to be evaluated, and on the right Google Street View imagery. Restrictions were implemented to ensure participants' controlled behavior. The participants have tasks to solve (going from point A to point B), timestamps and Google Street View locations are collected and sent via email to gather the data.
