# split

Split is a user test platform to evaluate navigation maps. It is composed of two windows: on the right, the map to be evaluated, and on the right google street view. Restrictions to ensure participants controlled behaviour were implemented. The participants have tasks to solve (going from point A to point B). In the end, timestamps and google street view locations are sent via email to collect the data.
